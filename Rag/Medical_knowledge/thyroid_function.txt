Thyroid function tests, including TSH, T3, and T4, assess how well the thyroid
gland regulates metabolism, energy levels, and body temperature.

WHO clinical guidance indicates that abnormal thyroid hormone levels may be
associated with symptoms such as fatigue, weight changes, heat or cold
intolerance, and changes in heart rate.

Thyroid test interpretation requires careful correlation with symptoms,
medications, pregnancy status, and follow-up testing when appropriate.
