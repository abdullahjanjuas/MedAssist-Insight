Blood pressure measures the force of blood against artery walls and is an
important indicator of cardiovascular health.

According to WHO and CDC guidance, persistently elevated blood pressure
increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease.

Blood pressure readings should be interpreted based on multiple measurements
taken on different occasions and in the context of overall cardiovascular risk.
