Platelets are blood components involved in clot formation and prevention of
excessive bleeding.

Low platelet counts may increase bleeding risk, while high platelet counts
may be associated with inflammation, infection, or bone marrow activity.

CDC guidance highlights that platelet counts should be interpreted in
conjunction with clinical findings such as bleeding, bruising, or clotting history.

Transient platelet abnormalities can occur during infections or inflammatory
conditions and may normalize without intervention.
