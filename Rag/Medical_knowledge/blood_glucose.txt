Blood glucose reflects the concentration of sugar in the blood and is a key
indicator of metabolic health.

According to CDC guidance:
- Persistently elevated blood glucose levels are associated with diabetes
  and increased risk of cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and nerve damage.
- Low blood glucose levels may cause symptoms such as dizziness, sweating,
  confusion, or weakness.

Blood glucose interpretation depends on whether the measurement was fasting,
post-meal, or random, as well as patient history and symptoms.

Lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and body weight play a major
role in blood glucose regulation.
