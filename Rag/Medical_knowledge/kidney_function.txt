Kidney function tests such as serum creatinine, blood urea, and estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) assess how well the kidneys filter waste
from the blood.

CDC guidance emphasizes early detection of kidney dysfunction to reduce
risk of progression and complications.

Hydration status, muscle mass, age, and medications can influence kidney
test results.
