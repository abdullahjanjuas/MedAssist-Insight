Hemoglobin (Hb) is a protein in red blood cells responsible for carrying oxygen
from the lungs to tissues and returning carbon dioxide to the lungs.

According to WHO guidance, low hemoglobin levels are commonly associated with
anemia, which may result from nutritional deficiencies (such as iron, vitamin B12,
or folate), chronic disease, blood loss, or inherited conditions.

High hemoglobin levels may be seen in dehydration, chronic lung disease, smoking,
or conditions that increase red blood cell production.

Hemoglobin values must be interpreted in the context of age, sex, altitude,
hydration status, and overall clinical condition.

Abnormal hemoglobin results should be discussed with a healthcare professional
to determine possible causes and need for further testing.
