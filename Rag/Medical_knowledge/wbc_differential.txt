White blood cells (WBCs) are part of the immune system and help protect the body
against infections and inflammatory processes.

Total WBC Count reflects the overall number of white blood cells.
Differential leukocyte count breaks this down into specific cell types:

Neutrophils are primarily involved in fighting bacterial infections and acute
inflammation.
Lymphocytes play a key role in viral infections and immune regulation.
Monocytes help remove debris and participate in chronic inflammation.
Eosinophils are associated with allergic reactions and parasitic infections.
Basophils are involved in allergic and inflammatory responses.

According to CDC clinical interpretation principles, changes in white blood cell
patterns may reflect infection, inflammation, stress, or immune-related conditions.

Single abnormal values should be interpreted cautiously and correlated with
symptoms, medical history, and repeat testing if necessary.
