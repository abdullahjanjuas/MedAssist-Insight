Liver function tests include measurements such as bilirubin, ALT, AST, ALP,
and total protein.

According to CDC guidance, abnormal liver test results may be associated with
liver inflammation, infection, medication effects, alcohol use, or metabolic
conditions.

Mild elevations may be temporary, while persistent abnormalities may require
further evaluation and monitoring.
