Red blood cell (RBC) indices provide information about the size, volume, and
hemoglobin content of red blood cells and are used to help classify different
types of anemia.

Total RBC Count reflects the number of red blood cells in circulation.
Packed Cell Volume (PCV or hematocrit) measures the percentage of blood volume
occupied by red blood cells.

Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) indicates the average size of red blood cells.
Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) represents the average amount of hemoglobin
per red blood cell.
Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) reflects the concentration
of hemoglobin within red blood cells.
Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) measures variation in red blood cell size.

WHO clinical guidance emphasizes that patterns across these indices are more
important than a single value. For example:
- Low MCV may suggest microcytic anemia (often iron-related)
- High MCV may suggest macrocytic anemia (e.g., vitamin B12 or folate deficiency)
- High RDW indicates increased variability in red blood cell size

Interpretation should always consider clinical symptoms and additional tests.
