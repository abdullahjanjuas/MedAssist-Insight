A lipid profile measures different types of fats in the blood, including
total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.

CDC guidelines emphasize that elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides are
associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, while HDL cholesterol
is considered protective.

Lifestyle modifications such as balanced diet, regular physical activity,
smoking cessation, and weight management are first-line measures for lipid
management.

Lipid values should be interpreted together with other cardiovascular risk
factors, including blood pressure, diabetes status, and family history.
